            React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple
            views for each state in your application, <br />
            and React will efficiently update and render just the right
            components when your data changes.

          <h2 className="text-gray-400 px-3">Component-Based</h2>
          <p>
            Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then
            compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written
            in JavaScript instead of templates <br /> you can easily pass rich
            data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

            We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,
            so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing
            code. <br /> React can also render on the server using Node and
            power mobile apps using React Native.
